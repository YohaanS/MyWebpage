  <h2>Basic Info</h2>
  <p>Aqua tots is a swim school I go <em>every</em> saturday! There are 8 levels. Level 1 and 2 and parent and baby levels. <em>Ages 2.5</em> or more make it to level 3 and it was my first level at aqua tots. We you move a new level you get a new wristband! I am in level 4. <strong>But now I have a hard time in breathing due to swimming and I have been in level 4 for <em>months</em> now.</strong> <strong>Also I forgot to tell you that level 8 is the <em>hardest</em> level.</strong> I go to the nearby <em>arizona avenue</em> aqua tots. Have fun swimming!</p>

  <h4>Swim Songs</h4>

  <p>
I bet you feel it now, baby<br>
Especially since we've only known each other one day<br>
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby<br>
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now<br>
