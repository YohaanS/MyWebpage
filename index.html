        <td>Level 2</td>
        <td>This Parent & Tot class is designed to help caregivers train their toddlers to explore and enjoy water while establishing safe boundaries. At this age, tots are curious and more inclined to explore, especially near water, which is why it is such an important time to show parents how to equip their toddlers with life-saving skills. In this class, you will:

          Explore & enjoy water together while establishing safe boundaries
          Safely submerge your tot
          Continue to help your toddler learn breath control
          Release your tot underwater to the instructor
          Help your little one learn independent kicking
          Continue to help your tot learn to roll over and back float
          Help your toddler begin to safely return to the pool‚Äôs edge</td>

  <h2 id="Info_heading">Basic Info</h2>
  <p id="info">Aqua tots is a swim school I go <em>every</em> saturday! There are 8 levels. Level 1 and 2 and parent and baby levels. <em>Ages 2.5</em> or more make it to level 3 and it was my first level at aqua tots. When you move a new level you get a new wristband! I am in level 4. <strong>But now I have a hard time in breathing due to swimming and I have been in level 4 for <em>months</em> now.</strong> <strong>Also I forgot to tell you that level 8 is the <em>hardest</em> level.</strong> I go to the nearby <em>Arizona avenue</em> aqua tots. Have fun swimming!</p>

  <h4 id="Song_heading">Swim Songs</h4>

  <p class="Songs">
I bet you feel it now, baby<br>
Especially since we've only known each other one day<br>
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby<br>
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now<br>
  </p>
<p class="Songs">
Location drop, now<br>
Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now<br>
Oh, what a cop out<br>
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out<br>
